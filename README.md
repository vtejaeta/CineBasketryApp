## Overview
Hello ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my project of CineBasketry app which was built with React, Redux. This project helps in getting thousands of movie details which are Top Rated, Popular, Upcoming using [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). This also allows user to search and get movie details based on its name of any language. Most of the movie details involves youtube trailer link.

Tech Stack used in this project:
- JavaScript Library: **React**
- State Management: **Redux**

When I saw project of [Ian Trent](https://moviac.iantrent.com/), I wish to make the clone of same UI. This motivated me to do project of Movie Library web app. Through this I came to know how to structure React-Redux web app and how to use routing with React Router.

```
